WELCOME TO VISITED 0.21
-----------------------

Hello, this is Visited,
a fast winroute proxy log analyzer.


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------

Under UNIX systems just type:

% make

Under WIN32 you need MINGW and MSYS (an easy way to get these and git
as a bonus is installing msysgit), then follow the above istructions.

For compilation problems please write an email to <camilohe@gmail.log>
with the exact problem, version of Visited, environment, GCC used, and so
on.

HOW TO HELP
-----------

Please send patches, I'll merge it, but be aware the project is now licensed
under the BSD license, it's no longer GPLed.

THANKS TO ...

Salvatore Sanfilippo <antirez@invece.org> for visitors <http://www.hping.org/visitors>.

Enjoy,
Camilo E Hidalgo Estevez
