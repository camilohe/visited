SECURITY FILE

This file will contain a list of bugs related to security problems found
in visitors. Currently no bug of this kind was reported or found.

VISITED CODE QUALITY AND AUDITING

Visited is tested with big log files to ensure that there aren't obvious
memory violation problems with normal log files, and is based on code written
with care about security.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS

Still it's a C program that does a lot of pointer math in order to
be fast, and its work is to process untrusted input (what's written in
log files is in part client-driven), this file is here to contain
detailed information if this kind of bugs will be found in future.

LIST OF SECURITY BUGS FOUND

  None for now.
